AGIMUS demo 04 visual servoing
-----------------------------

This demo shows the visual servoing capabilities of the AGIMUS architecture.
Expected behaviors (intention only):
    - The robot first sees an object and tries to keep the relative pose of object wrt camera constant.
    - The robot avoids obstacles.

---

### Dependencies

This demo requires source built of dependencies found in:
- [franka.repos](../franka.repos)
- [control.repos](../control.repos)
- [agimus_dev.repos](../agimus_dev.repos)


This demo is done using apriltag (but could also be done with happypose in the future), to use it you'll also need to install the package [olt_ros2_pipeline](https://github.com/agimus-project/olt_ros2_pipeline?tab=readme-ov-file#launch-apriltag) from source, note that can use apriltag from this package without installing happypose.

### Apriltag setup
the apriltag used can be found  [here](https://triagechallenge.darpa.mil/docs/AprilTag_0-20_family36h11.pdf),
the apriltag side size used was 44 mm, but can be modified [here](https://github.com/TheoMF/olt_ros2_pipeline/blob/topic/tmartinez/apriltag/config/tags_36h11.yaml#L22)

### Robot model selection

The demo support two different Franka robot models, selectable via the `arm_id` parameter:

| arm_id | Models |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| fer | Franka Emika Panda |
| fr3 | Franka Research 3 |

If not specified, the parameter `arm_id` is set to fer.

## Start the demo in simulation using the Panda robot.
```bash
cd workspace
reset && source install/setup.bash && ros2 launch agimus_demo_04_visual_servoing bringup.launch.py use_gazebo:=true gz_headless:=true use_rviz:=true
```
Then, in another terminal, you can use `static_transform_publisher` to update the reference used by the visual servoing task.
You can do so by iteratively starting and killing the following command, with varying `--[xyz]` options.
```
ros2 run tf2_ros static_transform_publisher --frame-id fer_link0 --child-frame-id current_object
# Then kill and, e.g.
ros2 run tf2_ros static_transform_publisher --frame-id fer_link0 --child-frame-id current_object --x 0.1
```

In RViz, you can visualize frames:
- current_object: the frame wrt which the vision reference is sent.
- camera_color_optical_frame: the current pose of the frame
- camera_color_optical_frame_reference: the desired pose of camera_color_optical_frame

## Start the demo on hardware using the Panda robot.

for the vision side you'll have to launch
```bash
ros2 launch olt_ros2_pipeline vision_bringup.launch.py
```
> [!NOTE]
> The libfranka version differs depending on the robot model. Make sure you use the correct control container to operate the real robot.

for the control side you'll have to launch
```bash
ros2 launch agimus_demo_05_pick_and_place bringup.launch.py arm_id:=fer robot_ip:=<fci-ip> use_ft_sensor:=false
```
